We did “SHOW-PASSWORDS” to get the username and password for the repo. Then we looked at the nmap to find ssh ports in an attempt to locate the repo; we tried to ssh into those hosts using the username we found before. The command that worked was “ssh -l git 10.3.31.243”. We entered the password from before and saw that there was a .git file called “pearOS.git”. We then cloned the git repo using “git clone git@10.3.31.243/pearOS.git”. Finally, following the instructions in the README, we were able to generate and sign our own certificate with their private signing key.
